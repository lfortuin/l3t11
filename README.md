When running this file, each tokenized sentence will be displayed, followed by the entities they contain. If the sentence does not contain a token, the message "No named entities found" will be displayed. 

There are two entities that have been explored, namely GPE and PERSON. Using the spacy.explai() funtion, more is displayed about what those entities entail. This information is included in the comment at the bottom of the python file.
